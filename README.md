## The WHY

Before I even get into who I am and what I do, let me explain _why_ I do web development. As a kid, I was alway taking apart my electronic toys, trying to figure out how they worked, and putting them back together. Occasionally, they’d even work once I reassembled them! Then, when my parents bought our first computer, I was hooked. It ran Windows 3.1. I learned pretty quickly some of those foundational principals of how computers worked. Some of my fondest memories from that era are of messing with the way the computer did stuff via the command line.

From then on, computers were my biggest fascination. Well into my early twenties, I was constantly toying with old computers and trying to learn more and more about tech. A few years ago, I was in a dead end retail job, wishing for something worthwhile to do. I did a lot of reading and decided that 

since the future was moving more and more to the web, then the web was where I needed to be.

## The WHO

I am a freelance web developer with just over a year of real-world experience under my belt. My current home is in the Portland metro area in Oregon, but I was born and raised in northwest New Mexico (yes, it is a state, and no, I do not speak Spanish). I’ve got an amazing wife and two wonderful little boys. and they always get top priority in my world. I’m an avid reader, sci-fi/fantasy fan, and gamer. Most of my life, I have always done very well with teaching myself new things, so I’m well-suited to the ever-changing demands of the web.

## The HOW

It took a few years of following other opportunities in the non-profit world (I was a youth pastor for a few years), but eventually my path led back to learning web design and development. I finally took the plunge and started learning through the wonderful folks at Team Treehouse. In January 2017 I landed my first legitimate client (a small WordPress-powered site for a small apartment building). Soon after I landed another client, and a couple more. I’ve now got a fairly steady stream of work, and I’m always learning new things as the web grows and changes.
