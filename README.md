## The WHY

Before I even get into who I am and what I do, let me explain _why_ I do web development. As a kid, I was alway taking apart my electronic toys, trying to figure out how they worked, and putting them back together. Occasionally, they’d even work once I reassembled them! Then, when my parents bought our first computer, I was hooked. It ran Windows 3.1. I learned pretty quickly some of those foundational principals of how computers worked. Some of my fondest memories from that era are of messing with the way the computer did stuff via the command line.

From then on, computers were my biggest fascination. Well into my early twenties, I was constantly toying with old computers and trying to learn more and more about tech. A few years ago, I was in a dead end retail job, wishing for something worthwhile to do. I did a lot of reading and decided that since the future was moving more and more to the web, then the web was where I needed to be.

## The WHO

I am a full time front-end developer who previously did freelance, and I have been professionally programming since 2017. My current home is Fresno, California. I recently moved from Portland, Oregon, where I lived for four years, but I was born and raised in New Mexico. I’ve got an amazing wife and two wonderful little boys. and they always get top priority in my world. I’m an avid reader, sci-fi/fantasy fan, and gamer. Most of my life, I have always done very well with teaching myself new things, so I’m well-suited to the ever-changing demands of the web.

## The HOW

It took a few years of following other opportunities in the non-profit world (I was a youth pastor for a few years), but eventually my path led back to learning web design and development. I finally took the plunge and started learning through the wonderful folks at Team Treehouse. In January 2017 I landed my first legitimate client (a small WordPress-powered site for a small apartment building). Soon after I landed another client, and a couple more, and so on. In late 2019, I was able to transition into full-time work with Little Rhino, LLC, a small WordPress agency based in Seattle.
